# Churn-Prediction-for-Telecom-Customers
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using a comprehensive dataset.
Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. 
Implemented various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate predictive performance. 
Utilized Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization. 
The project provided actionable insights to identify at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention strategies.
